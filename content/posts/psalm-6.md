```
For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David.

Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger.

Do not discipline me in your raging fury.

2 Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am frail.

Heal me, Lord, for my bones are shaking.

3 I am absolutely terrified,

and you, Lord—how long will this continue?

4 Relent, Lord, rescue me!

Deliver me because of your faithfulness.

5 For no one remembers you in the realm of death.

In Sheol who gives you thanks?

6 I am exhausted as I groan.

All night long I drench my bed in tears;

my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.

7 My eyes grow dim from suffering;

they grow weak because of all my enemies.

8 Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly,

for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping.

9 The Lord has heard my appeal for mercy;

the Lord has accepted my prayer.

10 They will be humiliated and absolutely terrified.

All my enemies will turn back and be suddenly humiliated.

```

The part of this Psalm that stands out the most to me is verses 4 to 5. It's almost like David is telling God "you should rescue me BECAUSE otherwise I'll be in hell where I won't remember you anymore". Almost shaming God into saving him. This veers towards the issue of why God would want anyone in hell if He is an all-loving God. Or another way is if God is full control and cares about His ego, wouldn't he want everyone to be with Him so they can praise Him?
