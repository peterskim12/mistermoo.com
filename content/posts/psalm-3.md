Psalm 3 NET

A psalm of David, written when he fled from his son Absalom.

Lord, how numerous are my enemies!

Many attack me.

2 Many say about me,

“God will not deliver him.” (Selah)

3 But you, Lord, are a shield that protects me;

you are my glory and the one who restores me.

4 To the Lord I cried out,

and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah)

5 I rested and slept;

I awoke, for the Lord protects me.

6 I am not afraid of the multitude of people

who attack me from all directions.

7 Rise up, Lord!

Deliver me, my God!

Yes, you will strike all my enemies on the jaw;

you will break the teeth of the wicked.

8 The Lord delivers;

you show favor to your people. (Selah)

Ok I'm really behind. This was one of those projects I took on when I was in-between jobs. And I thought "oh I have plenty of time". Regardless of whether I'm employed or not, it's hard to make space for reading the Bible unless you make it a priority.

I spent about an hour fixing the tech stuff for this site. I used to use render.com to auto-deploy changes, but I changed it to use Github Actions and Github Pages instead to eliminate the dependency on another service. 

Anyway, I have nothing to add here from my previous thoughts on [Psalm 2]({{< ref "psalm-2" >}}).
