> **Trust in God under Adversity**  
> *A Psalm of David, when he fled from his son Absalom.*  
> 1 O Lord, how many are my foes!  
>     Many are rising against me;  
> 2 many are saying to me,  
>     “There is no help for you[a] in God.” Selah  
>   
> 3 But you, O Lord, are a shield around me,  
>     my glory, and the one who lifts up my head.  
> 4 I cry aloud to the Lord,  
>     and he answers me from his holy hill. Selah  
>   
> 5 I lie down and sleep;  
>     I wake again, for the Lord sustains me.  
> 6 I am not afraid of ten thousands of people  
>     who have set themselves against me all around.  
>   
> 7 Rise up, O Lord!  
>     Deliver me, O my God!  
> For you strike all my enemies on the cheek;  
>     you break the teeth of the wicked.  
>   
> 8 Deliverance belongs to the Lord;  
>     may your blessing be on your people! Selah
