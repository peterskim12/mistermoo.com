> **God’s Promise to His Anointed**
> 
> 1 Why do the nations conspire  
>     and the peoples plot in vain?  
> 2 The kings of the earth set themselves,  
>     and the rulers take counsel together,  
>     against the Lord and his anointed, saying,  
> 3 “Let us burst their bonds apart  
>     and cast their cords from us.”  
> 
> 4 He who sits in the heavens laughs;  
>     the Lord has them in derision.  
> 5 Then he will speak to them in his wrath  
>     and terrify them in his fury, saying,  
> 6 “I have set my king on Zion, my holy hill.”  
> 
> 7 I will tell of the decree of the Lord:  
> He said to me, “You are my son;  
>     today I have begotten you.  
> 8 Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage  
>     and the ends of the earth your possession.  
> 9 You shall break them with a rod of iron  
>     and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.”  
> 
> 10 Now therefore, O kings, be wise;  
>     be warned, O rulers of the earth.  
> 11 Serve the Lord with fear; with trembling   
> 12 kiss his feet,  
> or he will be angry, and you will perish in the way,  
>     for his wrath is quickly kindled.  
> 
> Happy are all who take refuge in him.
