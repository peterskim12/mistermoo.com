For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David.

When I call out, answer me,

O God who vindicates me.

Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place.

Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer.

2 You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame?

How long will you love what is worthless

and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)

3 Realize that the Lord shows the godly special favor;

the Lord responds when I cry out to him.

4 Tremble with fear and do not sin.

Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways. (Selah)

5 Offer the prescribed sacrifices

and trust in the Lord.

6 Many say, “Who can show us anything good?”

Smile upon us, Lord!

7 You make me happier

than those who have abundant grain and wine.

8 I will lie down and sleep peacefully,

for you, Lord, make me safe and secure.

This Psalm is interesting because it starts out where David is still calling for help. But at the same time, he challenges his people to turn to God instead of loving what is worthless. He exhorts them to repent and trust in the Lord in order to receive His favor. Even though they are under duress, David has so much trust and faith in God to deliver them. 

Verse 7 says "You make me happier than those who have abundant grain and wine." This reminded me of a [Planet Money podcast episode](https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/1200121013/money-happiness-kahneman-killingsworth) I recently listened to that discusses whether money can actually make you happy. I think it'd be interesting if there was a study that tried to measure the happiness of religious people. And then combine faith and money by examining whether money makes religious people happier.
