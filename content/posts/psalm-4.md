For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David.

When I call out, answer me,

O God who vindicates me.

Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place.

Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer.

2 You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame?

How long will you love what is worthless

and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)

3 Realize that the Lord shows the godly special favor;

the Lord responds when I cry out to him.

4 Tremble with fear and do not sin.

Meditate as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways. (Selah)

5 Offer the prescribed sacrifices

and trust in the Lord.

6 Many say, “Who can show us anything good?”

Smile upon us, Lord!

7 You make me happier

than those who have abundant grain and wine.

8 I will lie down and sleep peacefully,

for you, Lord, make me safe and secure.
